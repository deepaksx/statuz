# üîß Extraction Failure Fix (v2.4.5)

## Problem

When users clicked "Extract" to extract project data from chat history, it was failing silently with the error message "Failed to extract project data".

## Root Cause

The issue had two parts:

### 1. **BatchAnalysisAgent Not Initialized When API Key Set Later**

- When the app starts **without** an API key, `batchAnalysisAgent` is not initialized (remains `null`)
- When user goes to Settings and sets the Gemini API key, the `setGeminiApiKey()` method only initialized `parserAgent`
- The `batchAnalysisAgent` remained `null` even after API key was set
- When extraction was attempted, the check `this.batchAnalysisAgent && this.batchAnalysisAgent.isReady()` failed
- Extraction was silently skipped with 0 counts returned

### 2. **No Clear Error Messages**

- The original code had an `if` condition that silently skipped extraction
- When prerequisites weren't met, it just returned success with 0 counts
- Users had no idea why extraction failed (API key missing? Group not watched? Agent not ready?)

## Solution

### 1. Added `updateApiKey()` Method to BatchAnalysisAgent

**File:** `packages/agents/src/batch-analysis-agent.ts`

```typescript
updateApiKey(apiKey: string): void {
  if (!apiKey) {
    this.isEnabled = false;
    console.warn('‚ö†Ô∏è  [BatchAnalysisAgent] API key removed - agent disabled');
    return;
  }

  this.genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(apiKey);
  this.model = this.genAI.getGenerativeModel({
    model: 'gemini-2.0-flash-exp',
    generationConfig: {
      temperature: 0.3,
      topK: 40,
      topP: 0.95,
      maxOutputTokens: 8192,
    },
  });
  this.isEnabled = true;
  console.log('‚úÖ [BatchAnalysisAgent] API key updated and re-initialized');
}
```

This allows the agent to be re-initialized when API key is set after app startup.

### 2. Updated `setGeminiApiKey()` in BackgroundService

**File:** `packages/background/src/service.ts`

```typescript
setGeminiApiKey(apiKey: string) {
  this.aiService.setApiKey(apiKey);
  this.config.geminiApiKey = apiKey;

  // Update or initialize Parser Agent with new API key
  if (this.parserAgent) {
    this.parserAgent.updateApiKey(apiKey);
  } else {
    this.parserAgent = new ParserAgent(apiKey);
    this.setupEventBusListeners();
  }

  // Update or initialize Batch Analysis Agent with new API key
  if (this.batchAnalysisAgent) {
    this.batchAnalysisAgent.updateApiKey(apiKey);
  } else {
    this.batchAnalysisAgent = new BatchAnalysisAgent(apiKey);
  }

  console.log('‚úÖ AI agents updated with new API key');
}
```

Now **both** agents are initialized/updated when API key is set.

### 3. Added Clear Error Messages

**File:** `packages/background/src/service.ts` - `extractProjectData()` method

Replaced the silent `if` condition with explicit error throwing:

```typescript
// Check prerequisites for extraction
if (!group.isWatched) {
  throw new Error('Group must be watched to extract project data. Please enable "Watch" for this group first.');
}

if (!this.batchAnalysisAgent) {
  throw new Error('AI extraction not available. Please set your Gemini API key in Settings first.');
}

if (!this.batchAnalysisAgent.isReady()) {
  throw new Error('AI extraction agent not ready. Please check your Gemini API key in Settings.');
}
```

Now users get **clear, actionable error messages** telling them exactly what's wrong.

## User Experience Before vs After

### Before (v2.4.4):
```
User: *clicks Extract*
App: "Failed to extract project data"
User: ??? (no idea why it failed)
```

### After (v2.4.5):
```
Scenario 1: Group not watched
User: *clicks Extract*
App: "Group must be watched to extract project data. Please enable 'Watch' for this group first."

Scenario 2: No API key set
User: *clicks Extract*
App: "AI extraction not available. Please set your Gemini API key in Settings first."

Scenario 3: API key invalid
User: *clicks Extract*
App: "AI extraction agent not ready. Please check your Gemini API key in Settings."
```

## Files Changed

1. `packages/agents/src/batch-analysis-agent.ts`
   - Added `updateApiKey()` method

2. `packages/background/src/service.ts`
   - Updated `setGeminiApiKey()` to initialize both agents
   - Updated `extractProjectData()` with clear error messages
   - Removed silent failure path

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Build succeeds without errors
- [ ] Start app without API key
- [ ] Set API key in Settings
- [ ] Verify BatchAnalysisAgent is initialized
- [ ] Upload chat history to a watched group
- [ ] Click "Extract" and verify extraction works
- [ ] Verify clear error if group not watched
- [ ] Verify clear error if API key missing

## Migration Notes

No database migrations required. This is a bug fix only.

Users who previously experienced extraction failures should now:
1. Go to Settings
2. Verify Gemini API key is set
3. Ensure group is watched (green "Watch" button)
4. Click "Extract" again
5. Extraction should now work with clear feedback

## Related Issues

- Extraction was silently failing for users who set API key after app startup
- No clear error messages made debugging impossible for users
- BatchAnalysisAgent remained uninitialized even when API key was set
