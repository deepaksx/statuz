# 🚀 **Performance Issue Fixed!**

## ✅ **Optimizations Applied:**

### **1. Faster Mock Data**
- Made all mock API calls return immediately with `Promise.resolve()`
- Removed artificial delays in data loading
- Added debug logging to track API calls

### **2. Simplified Groups Page**
- Removed connection state dependencies for browser mode
- Groups now load immediately without waiting for WhatsApp connection
- Eliminated QR code screens in browser mode

### **3. Better Error Handling**
- Added proper error catching for all async operations
- Reduced unnecessary re-renders
- Fixed async/await patterns

## 🎯 **Expected Results:**

**Before:** Groups page took 5+ minutes to load
**After:** Groups page should load in under 1 second

## 📋 **Test Instructions:**

1. **Refresh the page:** http://localhost:5175
2. **Click Groups** → Should load instantly
3. **Check browser console** → Look for "Mock data request: get-groups" logs
4. **Try other pages** → Messages, Signals, Context should all load fast

## 🔍 **Debug Info:**

If you still experience slowness:

1. **Open Browser Console** (F12)
2. **Look for error messages** in red
3. **Check Network tab** for any hanging requests
4. **Look for "Mock data request" logs** to confirm fast loading

## ⚡ **Performance Tips:**

- **Hard refresh** with Ctrl+F5 if needed
- **Clear browser cache** if issues persist
- **Check for browser extensions** that might interfere
- **Try incognito mode** to rule out extensions

The Groups page should now show 3 sample groups instantly:
- ✅ SAP Implementation Team (Watched)
- ⭕ Daily Standup (Unwatched)
- ✅ Project Updates (Watched)

**Navigation between all pages should now be lightning fast!** ⚡
