## How Data Gets Here

### 1. Upload Chat History (Step 1)
```
Groups â†’ Select Group â†’ Upload History â†’ Choose WhatsApp export file
```

This uploads all chat messages to the database.

### 2. Extract Project Data (Step 2)
```
Groups â†’ Select Group â†’ Extract â†’ Confirm
```

This uses AI to analyze messages and create:
- **Stories** - User stories extracted from conversations
- **Tasks & Subtasks** - Action items with owners
- **Risks** - Identified project risks
- **Decisions** - Key decisions made

The AI automatically:
- âœ… Classifies items into Epic/Story/Task/Subtask
- âœ… Estimates story points
- âœ… Detects SAP modules and transaction codes
- âœ… Assigns tasks to team members
- âœ… Identifies dependencies and blockers
- âœ… Provides expert recommendations

## Troubleshooting

### Backlog is Empty

**Reason:** No data extracted yet.

**Solution:**
1. Upload chat history first (Groups â†’ Upload History)
2. Then extract project data (Groups â†’ Extract)
3. Check Tasks page again

### Missing SAP Fields

**Reason:** AI didn't detect SAP context in messages.

**Solution:**
- Messages should mention SAP transaction codes (VA01, ME21N, etc.)
- Reference SAP modules (SD, MM, FI, etc.)
- Include transport request numbers
- Re-extract after adding more detailed messages

### No Story Points

**Reason:** Item is not a Story, or AI couldn't estimate complexity.

**Solution:**
- Only Stories get story points
- Ensure messages describe complexity/effort
- Can be manually updated in database if needed
